# Efficient-Cryptographic-Processing-for-Secure-Communication
This project focuses on a high-performance hardware architecture for modular arithmetic and group operations in an Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) system over a prime field. The implementation is designed to be efficient, balancing speed, area, and power consumption. It includes modular addition, subtraction, multiplication, and group operations (point addition and point doubling) optimized for FPGA synthesis.

# Features
Modular Arithmetic: Efficient implementations of modular addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
Group Operations: Hardware implementations for point addition and point doubling in Jacobian coordinates.
FPGA Implementation: Designed for Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA using VHDL, optimized for speed and resource utilization.

# Getting Started
Clone the repository.
Open the VHDL files in Xilinx ISE or a compatible FPGA development tool.
Synthesize and implement the design on the target FPGA platform.

# Prerequisites
Xilinx ISE 14.7 or newer
Virtex-7 FPGA board

# Usage
This project includes VHDL files for each modular arithmetic and group operation module. Integrate these modules into your ECC processor design as needed for cryptographic applications.
